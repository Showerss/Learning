# debugging: tracking down and fixing bugs

# syntax error: when something isnt structured correctly, missing a : or . , () etc
    # caught by the compiler

# runtime errors: only occur when the program is ran, sometimes called exceptions because its an exceptional case... found by the interpreter
    # such as dividing by 0 

# semantic errors: no errors are spat out on the program but the output is not what you wanted 

# expiremental debugging: basically just the concept that debugging is actively doing detective work and rerunning your program 

# natural languages 

# variables cant start with a number or contain special characters
