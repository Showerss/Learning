#     algo: procedural
#     heuristic: guessing

#     embedded systems: anywhere that systems arent necessarily seen, smart functions
#     bioinformatics: computers to analyze gene/dna
#     machine learning: ai 
#     human computer interactions: AR / XR / VR

#     interpreter goes line by line
#     compiler does the while program at once


# repl = read, evaluate, print, loop

# statements and expressions
    expressions give an output, statements just say something
